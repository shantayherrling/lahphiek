My friends have been getting frustrated with the overwhelming amount of bugs in the game. I myself never thought it was that bad. until today.

Dear Cryptic, I have been playing this game for several years and it has had it's ups and downs, but overall I have been willing to accept some things didn't work quite right. That is because a lot of things did: Missions were technically fine, for the most part. Admiralty was a great system. Doffing was sort of ok. Some of the STFs (sorry, TFOs ) were fine. Ship building was challenging and rewarding to get right because the mechanics seemed to work. The Voth BZ was great. The Badlands Solve my cryptic clue. please. Welcome to QQR. The Ironing Board.

Victory of Life was expressly stated that Romulans would now have access to their allied factions ship's for Tier 5 and 6. Before this change Romulans where restricted to just flying Tiers 1-4. Cryptic has fixed it part way and has given us access to fleet ships and T-6 allied ships but have not finished. It is not complete. There are still many ships we do not have access to. Romulans do not have access to regular dilithium ships for T5 or above. I implore the community Q: No-hoper like Doctor Walters (7)? The answer is 7 letters long. Please help. I can't figure Alright, I haven't played Star Trek Online seriously in over a year now. The primary reason being the PvE queue system is AWFUL with the queue revamp.

So I wanted to push the limits of what a Science captain could do in an exotic torpboat, and as a result, decided to roll a Romulan. It then made sense to balance the build slightly away from EPG-at-all-costs and instead focus on a high crit build. On the whole, this has worked well. Exotic boff abilities crit in the 80% plus range and most other damage sources and weapons in the 40% plus range. Unfortunately, almost to the day that I finished the build, a bug crept into Secondary Deflectors. Please be patient.  Cryptic Launcher Autoupdate Error  EDIT: May have found a fix. Although almost everything else connected to the internet was working, when I tried a few other games, they also couldn't connect to their servers. Dear Cryptic, the current buggy animation system is an absolute catastrophe.

Improved Camera is a mod built from reversing of Enhanced Camera, whose purpose is to get the same functionality in SE. Now it is in beta, and works in 1.5.39, 1.5.62, and "probably" all versions in between, with the same dll. It "may" work in future updates, too.
