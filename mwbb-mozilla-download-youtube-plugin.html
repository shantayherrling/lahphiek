Hi all, sorry if this is something known or already posted about but I've been searching for hours and can't find a fix. https://i.imgur.com/HTaljsi.png As you can see the favicons on my bookmarks bar are showing the YouTube logo on some pages, but they're not actually YouTube. The ones shown in this screenshot are Reddit and Twitter. Any idea why this would be? Application Basics ------------------ Name: Firefox Version: 55.0.3 Build ID: 20170824053622 Update Channel: release User Agent. Not sure how many other programs would have this issue, but Firefox and a program called "Don't Sleep" that I use to keep the computer from shutting down and sleeping frequently crash once I get full load in games, Overwatch specifically. I even had windows explorer crash on me once, but I can't figure out why. According to Task Manager and MSI Afterburner my cpu usage is only around 70-80%, my gpu is sitting around 90-max. RAM isn't really being fully utilized, not much of an issue.

I'm writing this guide in order to help anybody who is interested in installing Copperhead OS and has no experience whatsoever in flashing/modifying phones like I did. In my opinion the operating system is excellent for individuals who want privacy and security in an age where it seems like our digital identities are increasingly tied to our physical lives I really like this browser, but it eats my cookies sometimes. My cookies.sqlite is about 1,50MB (1 572 864 bytes) but at seemingly random times when I close the Waterfox browser it changes the size of the cookies.sqlite file to 524 288 bytes. This is always the same exact size after the change and I'm no longer logged in where I'm supposed to be logged in/have access. Using the backup file fixes it. Anyone else had this issue? It's using the C:\Users\ username \AppData\Roaming\Waterfox\Profile. 
Bit of an odd one. I'm running on a computer where Firefox's hardware video decoding doesn't seem to work properly for 1080p 60FPS Youtube videos. At the moment I simply copy the link and open them in Edge, but it'd be nice if they automatically opened in an IE renderer. Does such a thing exist? about:support Application Basics ------------------ Name: Firefox Version: 50.1.0 Build ID: 20161208153507 Update Channel: release User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows. I just want to say that I have been a Firefox user since I can remember. I refuse to use Chrome because of its tie-ins with Google, but I have some serious issues with the new Firefox update. After my Firefox auto-updated to version 57 (a.k.a. the "Quantum" update), I was very disappointed in the experience. Biggest issue: The tab bar at the top of the window is very transparent. I have a dark background, so I could not see any of the text in the tabs, as the dark text blended into my wallpa. For those who don't want to read my rant here's a TLDR: you can speed up a sluggish firefox by this one simple change: urlbar: about:config dom.ipc.processCount Change integer value from 1 to 4 or 8 depending on your computer. I have 8 cores so I changed to 8 and its able to handle over 100 tabs now. (Other things you can do is cut all the 'timeout' values to 25% of their value. Timeouts are another reason why the software hangs) --- --- Intro There are at least 2 reasons. The issue started around 1 day after I got the device, and is still going on (through 8.0.0 + security update). If this would help, here is the output of `pm list packages -f` package:/data/app/com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping-1/base.apk=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping package:/system/priv-app/CarrierSetup/CarrierSetup.apk=com.google.android.carriersetup package:/system/priv-app/CtsShimPrivPrebuilt/CtsShimPrivPrebuilt.apk=com.android.cts.priv.ctsshim package:/data/app/com.go. I've noticed many are switching over to Safari with the realization that Chrome is horribly inefficient on all platforms ( While certainly more limited than Chrome, many of the popular extensions have made their way over to Safari. I thought I'd share the ones that I tend to use in case some were wondering how to have some of their favourite functionality of Chrome when using Safari. It can be a bit tricky so put aside at least 20mins to get it up and running, but after that initial setup it's easy. Make sure you have preferably a mic-headset or simply a pair of headphones/earphones if you are using a laptop with an inbuilt mic.
