Hi, I’m new to this sub. I’m a Coldplay fan since 2011 (I was 10 years old back then). I loved the first three albums and liked Viva La Vida and Mylo Xyloto, but when Ghost Stories was released, I remember not liking it at all, for no real reason. I was in my ‘Green Day era’, maybe that’s why I kinda ‘abandoned’ Coldplay around 2014. From that point, I rejected to listen again to Ghost Stories and I completely ignored A Head Full Of Dreams. This days I’ve been listening again to Ghost Stories.

Il 2004 fu un anno tranquillo per i Coldplay, passato per la maggior parte lontano dai riflettori, riposando dai tour e registrando il loro terzo album. A maggio, Coldplay presero in giro i fan con una nuova canzone e un nuovo video sul loro sito ufficiale per celebrare la nascita della figlia di Martin, Apple.

Coldplay is an English rock band from London, England. They've been a band since January 16, 1998 when they lost a demotape competition on XFM in London. Hello everyone, I have been a massive Radiohead fan since TKOL era, about 6 years ago now (how time goes so quickly,) before I had a look into Radiohead's discography I was a die hard Coldplay fan. But I had really lost faith in the direction Their 2011 album Mylo xyloto was going, so I thought I'd just wait until their next album I'd actually enjoy. (Hasn't happened yet, though their new EP has shown lots of promise for their future) one of the ways I find new music is by looking towards 
Depois do sucesso de Parachutes, Coldplay volta para o estúdio em setembro de 2001 para começar a trabalhar em seu segundo álbum A Rush of Blood to the Head, mais uma vez com produção de Ken Nelson. Intro Pop music is less about genres and origins and more about trends. Great pop music is both of its era and transcends it, still able to sound fresh yet also perfectly captures the world it exists in. To honor that and to take trips down memory lane we'll be creating our weekly year playlists "Now That's What I Call /r/Popheads."

I've been looking forward to this deliberately-timed Appreciation, as now it's time to discuss my favourite song of all time, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall. When released in 2011, it was criticised as it often is now, for being too pop. A user on this sub in fact despises this song (https://www.reddit.com/r/Coldplay/comments/3v500s/seven_albums_seven_days_day_5_mylo_xyloto/cxkg3k3/?utm_content=permalinkamputm_medium=frontamputm_source=redditamputm_name=Coldplay) for sounding like a Miley.

I'm curious, how would you guys feel about Coldplay coming to the farm? They're undoubtably one of the biggest bands on the planet and with their next album being their last (so they say), I imagine the festival organizers have had them in discussion as a possible headliner. The band gets a ton of hate for whatever reason (the Joe Satriani shit, their music is poppy), but they put on an incredible live show and in my opinion have put out some really solid records (XampY, Parachutes Coldplay, British rock group whose melodic piano-driven anthems lifted it to the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century. Coldplay was formed in 1998 at University College, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist Chris Martin. After completing Prospekt's March , it's time to begin our sixth season of Coldplay survivor. This time, the album we'll rip apart bit by bit is Mylo Xyloto , Coldplay's fifth studio album released in 2011. In the eyes of many, this album marks the start of a shift away from the band's original sound, incorporating more electronic sounds and pop influences. As such, there are many wide-ranging opinions about this album, and that should lead to an interesting contest! --- Please listen

Mylo Xyloto. Hi guys! Im just interested in knowing what are some songs (preferably songs that don't fall in the gospel genre) that connect you with God? For instance Coldplay has always connected me to God and today as I was listening to the song U.F.O. from their 2011 Mylo Xyloto album I just started to weep and made a short prayer. Here are the lyrics: gtLord I don't know which way I am going which way the river's going to flow it just seems that upstream I keep rowing still Mylo Xyloto wasn't announced officially until August 2011, but the teasing began sometime around 2010, before Christmas Lights released. The first real glimpse we got into everything was with the infamous 'Hypnofeed #1' in early-to-mid 2010. (I have looked and looked for a link, but it appears Coldplay took it down or made it private.) In it was essentially a large clip of random studio sounds, pieces of songs, etc. Backwards, too. It had a MX-like gloss over the video and it seems like everyone. So, I figured that I would hop on board this new trend that seems to be sweeping /r/music (thanks, u/JimmehFTW, for kickstarting this!) and do a guide to the discography of my favorite band, Coldplay. Now, I know that much of the Reddit community approaches Coldplay with feelings ranging from ambivalence to intense hatred, but hopefully this guide gives everyone a chance to better appreciate their discography. A note: For each album, I've selected some tracks to highlight. I don't During the first half of season one, we see the gems “bubbling” the corrupted gems that they often come across after defeating them. The latter detail is revealed during the midseason finale, while the former is known earlier on. In episode 35, “Lion 3: Straight to Video”, nine episodes after the season one midseason finale, we find a very peculiar bubble inside Lion’s mane. It appears in a glance no longer than five seconds long. And that’s just it; it’s there with no current explanation. Lead singles and their album's release dates: Shiver was released March 6 2000. Parachutes was released July 10th. In My Place was released August 5 2002. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released August 26. Speed Of Sound was released May 23, 2005. XampY was released June 6th. Violet Hill was released May 9th 2008. Viva La Vida was released June 11th. Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall was released June 3, 2011. Mylo Xyloto came out October 19th. Respectively I looked around for a while and didn't see anything about this, so I'll go ahead and post it. Here's what it says: "Stepping back from the blazing energy of 2008's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends and 2011's Mylo Xyloto, Coldplay's sixth album is an introspective, bittersweet meditation on love and loss that sounds every bit as spectral as its name suggests. The band's gift for soaring melodies is evident throughout Ghost Stories- particularly on the magnetic first single, "Magic". 
"After opening with a somber, sparely accompanied melody, "Atlas" blooms with gauzy production and sweeping percussion. The track, Coldplay's first new studio recording since 2011's grandiose Mylo Xyloto, is an aptly cinematic theme song for the forthcoming second instalment of The Hunger Games series." (iTunes Editors' Notes) via coldplaying.com ( The excitement building is getting insane. I made a custom live album setlist type thing. I didn't want to post the link for fear of being banned or whatever; I don't know the rules. It features all live songs from Glastonbury and Toronto so it wouldn't be illegal or anything; everything on here can technically be found for free.but if anyone wished for a download, I'd gladly pm it. (It's quite long but I think it's full of the best live versions of each song. Oh, and I also structured it to go from the slower more reflective songs Albums Nelson composed: 2000: Coldplay - Parachutes 2002: Coldplay - A Rush of Blood to the Head 2005: Coldplay - XampY Albums Eno composed: 2008: Coldplay - Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends 2011: Coldplay - Mylo Xyloto I'm not bashing here, but I feel like ever since Brian Eno came on the scene, Coldplay has been a lot less Coldplay. They're still amazing don't get me wrong, but not what they used to be. And of course changes happen, but what was going the right direction Cover Art: Track List: 1. Mylo Xyloto 2.
